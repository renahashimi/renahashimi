# Hi there, my name is Rena Hashimi ðŸ‘‹
I am a Front-end Developer. I recently completed my studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## About me
I am 35 years old and live in Oslo. I am married, a mother of two beautiful children, and work full-time in optics. With all this on my plate, I also studied to become a Front-end Developer at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and I have now completed my studies.

Since I can remember, Iâ€™ve always had a great passion for IT, coding, web development, and design. After working in customer service for almost 16 years, it was time for a career change. I decided to fulfill my dream of becoming a developer, and I am now working on developing my skills in this field.
