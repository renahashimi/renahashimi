## Hi, I'm Rena! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front-End Developer based in Oslo, Norway, passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I specialize in creating seamless, interactive digital experiences that not only meet but exceed user expectations.

Iâ€™ve always had a deep interest in IT, coding, and web development, and after almost 16 years in customer service, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a developer. I recently completed my studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, where I gained hands-on experience with modern web technologies and UI/UX principles.

Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web design and development. I love exploring design aesthetics to refine my creative skills, and I approach every project with the aim of blending creativity with functionality. I believe in creating intuitive and efficient user experiences that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
